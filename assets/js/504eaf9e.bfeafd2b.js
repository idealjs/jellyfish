It is the core of the game engine, it is responsible for loading and unloading game scenes, managing game objects and components, and managing game resources.\nImagine we are creating a game scene after we successfully import the gltf asset, the first thing we do is to load the asset to the scene, but apparantly we can\u2019t directly load gltf file to the runtime using third party gltf loader, one of the reason is that some of the asset inside gltf is reusable such as textures and mesh, these assets are what we want to duplicate in our runtime scene to fulfill the complexity, for example, we have a gltf file for a rock, we want to place 100 same rocks into the scene, if we load this gltf using third party loader, the only way is to call that load function 100 times, more importantly, we can\u2019t reuse textures from this gltf to combine other meshes from another gltf.\nThe approach our engine implement is a runtime loading program called .meta file loader. The .meta of a gltf can be the scene structure of that gltf and a bunch of reference to its metadata, after gltf asset comes through the Asset IO Engine pipeline, it will be parsed into several other metadata such as texture"))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
